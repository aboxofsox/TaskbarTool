# TaskbarTool
Windows 11 doesn't come with any easy way to move your tsakbar. In fact, you can't even resize it. Microsoft may or may not add this feature into the UI in the future, but for now, we have to use other means to customize the taskbar.

### Usage
Go to the releases section and download the zip folder containing the binaries to run the application. It's not "signed" so you'll get a nice warning from UAC. It's safe to run this application. The only thing it really does is change some registry key values so that you don't have to dig through it and do it yourself.

### Prerequisites
- Requires .NET 5

### Soon™️
- [x] Realign taskbar icons when aligned to the left or right
- [ ] Remember open folders so when `explorer.exe` is reset, you don't lose out on anything
- [x] Fix system tray when aligned to the left or right
- [x] Ability to change taskbar height.
